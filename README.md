## Work Experience
### Research Scientist II - University of Texas at San Antonio (August 2023 - Present)
- Developed a question-answering chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to recommend books based on user reading interests and preferences.
- Leveraged OpenAI’s API, Prompt Engineering, and Langchain memory to enable personalized conversations and used Pinecone’s vector database to enhance recommendation accuracy.
- Modeled traffic scenarios as semantic scene graphs and analyzed for risk through safety metrics and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
- Proposed an explainable action recognition model to monitor driver distraction using a visual dictionary of human actions, achieving a Top-1 accuracy of 80.2% on a dataset of 10k+ videos.

## Projects
### [Human Action Recognition: Helping Autism](https://github.com/patelandpatel/AI-Data-driven-models-in-Human-Action-Recognition)
- Designed an AI/ML-based pilot program for recognizing human actions to assist autistic patients and their caregivers.
- Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract spatial features from video and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to identify temporal relationships between frames, achieving 84% accuracy.
- Saved 120 hours per patient monthly in manual monitoring during the experimental phase.

### [Snore Detection and Response Using a Fuzzy Inference System](https://github.com/patelandpatel/Snoring-Audio-Classifiction)
- Led the creation of a snore detection system using CNN and Fuzzy Logic to analyze snoring sounds and trigger responses.
- Developed algorithms using Python, Matlab, and TensorFlow for audio signal processing, reducing snoring duration by 30%.
- Implemented haptic feedback notification for real-time intervention, improving users' sleep quality.

## Skills
- **Developer Tools:** Microsoft Azure, Keras, scikit-learn, OpenCV, Google Cloud Platform, NumPy
- **Programming Languages:** Python, MySQL, MATLAB, Power BI
