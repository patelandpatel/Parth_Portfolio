# Peoject 1 : Snoring Detection using CNN

## Overview
This project aims to detect snoring sounds using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Snoring is a common problem that affects sleep quality and can indicate underlying health issues. By developing a CNN model, this project seeks to automatically detect snoring events in audio recordings, providing a tool for sleep analysis and monitoring.
